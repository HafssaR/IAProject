Email, Spam or Ham?


The project consists of the realization of an anti-spam; program that
fulfills the email recognition by separating spam emails from normal and standard ones.
Our project is considered as a concrete classification that allows to manipulate all the
emails and to simulate their type (SPAM OR NOT) based on their contents. It offers the
possibility to analyze automatically when learning independently.
